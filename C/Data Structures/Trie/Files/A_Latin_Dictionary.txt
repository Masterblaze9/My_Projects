na latin dictionary or harpers latin dictionary often referred to as lewis and short or ls is a popular englishlanguage lexicographical work of the latin language published by harper and brothers of new york in and printed simultaneously in the united kingdom by oxford university press history the work is usually referred to as lewis and short after the names of its editors charlton t lewis and charles short it was derived from the english translation by ethan allen andrews of an earlier latingerman dictionary wrterbuch der lateinischen sprache by the german philologist wilhelm freund in turn based on ijg schellers latingerman dictionary of the andrews translation was partially revised by freund himself then by henry drisler and was finally edited by short and lewis the division of labour between the two editors was remarkably unequal short a very thorough but slow worker produced material for the letters a through c but b and c were lost by harpers meaning that his work now only appears in the letter a pages while lewis was solely responsible for the entries beginning with the letters b through z pages who worked on his spare time from his law practice in lewis published a heavily abridged version the dictionary entitled an elementary latin dictionary for the use of students sometimes called the elementary lewis it is still in print today the adoption of the book by oxford university press was the result of the failure of its own project to create a new latinenglish dictionary in henry nettleship and john mayor had been commissioned to produce a new latin dictionary based on a fresh reading of the sources but after mayor withdrew from the project nettleship was unable to complete it on his own he eventually published his research as notes on lewis and short while the press had earlier published john riddles translation of schellers latingerman dictionary this was a much more expensive book the press thus adopted harpers latin dictionary as a stopgap measure paying harper and brothers per cent royalties harper and brothers sold its rights to the american book company in shortly before its bankruptcy from the time of its publication many scholars have criticized the dictionary for its errors and inconsistencies because of various circumstances however no replacement was attempted until with the oxford latin dictionary which was completed in the dictionarys full text is available online from the perseus project lewis and short is also available for offline consultation by means of various applications comparison with other dictionaries among classicists lewis and short has been largely superseded by the oxford latin dictionary called the old for short lewis and short incorporated material from existing latin dictionaries the old by contrast started from scratch following procedures similar to those of the wellregarded oxford english dictionary thanks to the increased availability of modern editions the old editors had access to a larger variety of classical works although classicists still consult lewis and short they tend to prefer the old on the other hand lewis and short remains a standard reference work for medievalists renaissance specialists and early modernists as the dictionary covers late and medieval latin if somewhat inconsistently the old when used on its own rarely meets their needs since it was decided early in the olds planning that the work would not encompass works written later than ad a few exceptions were made for especially important texts from the late classical period such as augustines de civitate dei but for periods later than that the old is considerably less useful the dictionary of medieval latin from british sources supplements the old for medieval usage of latin words in cases where lewis and short do not answer a medieval usage question j f niermeyers mediae latinitatis lexicon minus often supplies an answer the lexicon minus was completed in by c van de kieft after niermeyers death and has since become a standard reference work more recent editions of the lexicon minus have corrections and expansions also in later editions all words are defined in english french and german making it of greater international importance than lewis and short the glossarium ad scriptores media et infirmae latinitatis completed in by charles du fresne commonly referred to as du cange after the authors title the sieur du cange is now less frequently used as niermeyers lexicon minus incorporates much of its information on occasion people confuse lewis and short or ls with liddell and scott its greek counterpart entitled a greekenglish lexicon the and later editions of liddell and scott are commonly referred to by the abbreviation lsj after the names of its editors liddell scott and the editor of the revision jones see also oxford latin dictionary dictionary of medieval latin from british sources william whitakers words references see
