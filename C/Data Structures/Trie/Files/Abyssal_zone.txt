the abyssal zone is the abyssopelagic layer or pelagic zone that contains the very deep benthic communities near the 
bottom of oceans abyss derives from the greek word meaning bottomless at depths of to metres to feet this zone remains 
in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight these regions are also characterised by continuous cold and lack of 
nutrients the abyssal zone has temperatures around c to c f to f through the large majority of its mass it is the deeper 
part of the midnight zone which starts in the bathypelagic waters above its permanent inhabitants for example riftia 
pachyptila the giant tube worm found near hydrothermal vents in the pacific ocean are able to withstand the immense 
pressures of the ocean depths up to megapascals psi the area below the abyssal zone is the sparsely inhabited hadal zone 
the zone above is the bathyal zone these three zones belong to the deepsea realm above on the continental platform there 
are respectively the euphotic and dysphotic zones the abyssal zone lies partially in the dysphotic and partially in the 
aphotic zones trenches the deep trenches or fissures that plunge down thousands of metres feet below the ocean floor for 
example the midoceanic trenches such as the mariana trench in the pacific are almost unexplored previously only the 
bathyscaphe trieste the remote control submarine kaiko and the nereus have been able to descend to these depths however 
as of march one vehicle the deepsea challenger was able to penetrate to a depth of metres ft see also abyssal plain deep
