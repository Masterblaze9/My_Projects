aa amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis ie a disease characterized by the abnormal deposition of fibers of insoluble 
protein in the extracellular space of various tissues and organs in aa amyloidosis the deposited protein is serum 
amyloid a protein saa an acutephase protein which is normally soluble and whose plasma concentration is highest during 
inflammation causes aa amyloidosis is a complication of a number of inflammatory diseases and infections dysimmune 
diseases rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis crohns disease and ulcerative colitis chronic infections 
tuberculosis bronchiectasis chronic osteomyelitis autoinflammatory diseases familial mediterranean fever fmf mucklewells 
syndrome mws cancer hodgkins lymphoma renal cell carcinoma chronic foreign body reaction siliconeinduced granulomatous 
reaction pathology the saa protein is mainly deposited in the liver spleen and kidney and aa amyloidosis can lead to 
nephrotic syndrome current clinical research kiacta eprodisate disodium is currently being evaluated as a protector of 
renal function in aa amyloidosis transmission of amyloidosis there is evidence that eating amyloid fibers may lead to 
amyloidosis this evidence is based on studies in cattle chickens mice and cheetahs thus in a sense saa amyloidosis may 
be considered a contagious disease although whether this occurs or is important in the development of naturally 
occurring amyloidosis remains unknown nevertheless because amyloid fibers can be detected in muscle in low amounts it 
raises some concern about whether people could develop amyloidosis as a result of ingesting meat from an animal with the
